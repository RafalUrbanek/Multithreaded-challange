# multithreaded-challenge

The main goal of the task is to create two-way client-server communication.

The task should be started from the client side. The socket for a given client should be initialized there. 
After selecting the appropriate mode to be selected from the menu, e.g. 1 buy ticket, server logic must be implemented.

More technical assumptions are described in the code.

Purpose of the task:
Start the server and 5 client applications (can be Windows/Linux terminal).
1 of the clients is to send 2 messages to the server.
# Prove that 5 threads were generated after 6 messages were sent.
Use the method for counting active threads, which is on the server side.
You can write tests, you can visually show the effect.
I am interested in both the correct final result and the quality of the task in terms of code consistency.

After completing the quest, there are 2 more quests left.
